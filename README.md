# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## **Overview of the Analysis**
In response to the "silver tsunami" an expected big wave of retirements Pewlett Hackard has identified that it needs to analyse the effects of the upcoming issue in order to assess it and to devise a plan to mitigate the implications caused by the "silver tsunami". Hence, this analysis is devised to create two lists that will  help with determining the number of retiring employees by title, and the employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.  


## **Results**

### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
The first objective was to create a list that includes the number of retiring employees categorized based on their title.

* The first insight that can be taken from this analysis is that the total number of retiring employees is 72458.

* The two categories senior staff and senior engineer will experience the an alarming number of retirements 25,916 and 24926 respectively.

#### The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
The objective behind this portion of the analysis was to identify the current employees that are eligible for the mentorship program based on their date of birth.

* The total number of employees that qualify for the mentorshp program is 1,549.

* Eventhough the mentorship program will help with replacing some of the retiring employees, but it cannot resolve the issue as it is. Either the qualifications are eased to allow for more qualifications or the company will have to hire a large number of new employees.
